description: On this page, we describe the sources of our data and the cleaning process in detail. The goal is to ensure that anyone visiting our website can largely replicate our analyses by running this script on the original datasets to clean and prepare them for analysis.

## SECTION 1: Data Sources

### 1.1 Load Data Script

```{r}
source(
  "scripts/clean_data.R",
  echo = FALSE # Use echo = FALSE or omit to suppress code output
)
```

First, you can load the data set here: [**cleaning script**](/scripts/clean_data.R).

## 1.2 Data Sourcing

Our analysis begins with **base data** obtained from the [National Center of Education Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/), a federal agency appointed to serve the U.S. Department of Education. This data comes from two primary surveys:  

1. **The Common Core of Data (CCD)**  
2. **The Private School Survey (PSS)**  

Both surveys integrate data from additional sources, including state dropout and completion data files and the Local Education Agency Universal Survey. Additionally, finance data was utilized for certain variables. These datasets were originally collected by the **Institute of Education Sciences** to analyze education trends and further initiatives to improve access to higher education.  

While the data is accessible directly from the NCES, the retrieval process can be tedious, as it is collected at state and local levels.

In our `clean_data.R` script, we used the **`tidyverse`** package to efficiently manipulate and prepare the data for analysis. The script:  

- Reads an RData file (`clean_data.R`) located in the `datasets` directory.  
- Saves the cleaned version as an **RDS file** (`our_data_clean.rds`) in the `scripts` directory using the `saveRDS()` function.  
- Uses `readRDS()` to ensure the cleaned data can be accessed easily for further exploration.

### 1.3 Key Variables in Cleaned Data Set  

The cleaned dataset contains the following variables:  

- **School-Level Data**:  
  - *School Name*  
  - *State Name*  
  - *Grades 1-8 Students*  
  - *Grades 9-12 Students*  
  - *Male Students* / *Female Students*  

- **Race/Ethnicity Breakdown**:  
  - *American Indian/Alaska Native Students*  
  - *Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students*  
  - *Hispanic Students*  
  - *White Students*  
  - *Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Students*  

- **Other Variables**:  
  - *Pupil/Teacher Ratio*  

We selected these variables based on their relevance as potential contributing factors to school enrollment trends.  
- **Race/Ethnicity** reflects cultural disparities and access to resources in segregated communities, making it essential for analyzing systemic issues.  
- **Gender** was included due to existing disparities in mental health and learning outcomes between males and females.  
- **Pupil/Teacher Ratio** was considered because lower-income communities often experience resource shortages, which can affect school enrollment and perceived quality.

### 1.4 Government-Aided Lunch Program Data

```{r}
suppressWarnings(
  source("scripts/gov_lunch_program.R", echo = FALSE)
)
```

From the same **ELSI** data source, we incorporated data on **federal aid programs** (Free and Reduced Lunch Programs). This dataset, labeled **`ELSI_aid`**, includes:  

- State Name  
- School Name  
- Total number of students receiving:  
  - *Free Lunch* (split by race and age)  
  - *Reduced Price Lunch* (split by race and age)  
- Lowest and highest grades offered by the school.  

You can load it here:  [**cleaning script**](/scripts/gov_lunch_program.R).

We were specifically interested in understanding whether participation in aid programs varies across racial groups and whether these trends differ by state.

### 1.5 Additional Census Data

To add further depth to our analysis, we sourced **demographic data** from the **U.S. Census Bureau**. This auxiliary dataset provides information about each state's racial breakdown at the county level. By cross-referencing this data with school locations, we aimed to identify regional patterns in enrollment trends.  

The following variables were included in this dataset:  
*INSERT VARIABLES HERE*.

## SECTION 2: Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing

To ensure the integrity and accuracy of our analysis, we implemented a rigorous data cleaning process across all three datasets.  

### 2.1 **Cleaning School Enrollment Data**  
- **Handling Missing Data**:  
  - Converted placeholders (`†`, `-`, `‡`) to `NA` for clarity.  
  - Removed rows with any remaining `NA` values to maintain consistency.  

- **Standardizing State Names**:  
  - Ensured uniform capitalization and removed duplicate state columns to avoid redundancy.  

- **Eliminating Errors**:  
  - Removed negative values, as they represented erroneous entries.  

---

### 2.2 **Cleaning Government Lunch Program Data**  
- Minimal cleaning was required for this dataset.  
- Columns were added for consistency with the **school enrollment data**:  
  - Limited the time frame to school years **2018–2019 to 2022–2023**.  
  - Removed redundant constant columns, such as repeated state names.  

---

### 2.3 **Cleaning Census Data**  
The **U.S. Census data** required additional cleaning due to its treatment of *Hispanic/Latino* as an ethnicity rather than a race. This differs from our school enrollment dataset, which classifies *Hispanic* as a race.  

To address this discrepancy:  
- We created a new *Hispanic* category from the Census ethnicity data.  
- Adjusted the remaining racial categories proportionally to reflect non-Hispanic populations.  

While this approach is not a perfect representation, it preserves the general proportions needed for meaningful analysis.

## SECTION 3: Final Notes  

The cleaned and standardized datasets allow us to uncover patterns and generate insights into various influences on school enrollment, participation in federal aid programs, and demographic trends. This pre-processed data provides a robust foundation for the analysis presented in subsequent sections.
