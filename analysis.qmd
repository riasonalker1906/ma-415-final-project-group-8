## Introduction

Throughout this semester, our team has aimed to answer the following questions:

> *Is dependency on Free and Reduced Lunch programs in public schools proportional to the minority population in those areas? That is, are more students enrolled in such programs when they come from an area that is predominantly African American groups, Hispanic groups, etc.?*

By looking at public school data retained from the **Common Core** and cross-comparing with **Census data** obtained from the government, we have been able to compile our findings as presented below.

### 1.1 Top 10 Schools with the Highest Number of Students Enrolled in Free and Reduced Lunch Programs

We start by extracting the top 10 schools from the school year **2022–2023** with the highest number of students enrolled in government-aided lunch programs. Here, we considered both the **Free Lunch Program** and the **Reduced Lunch Program**, combining data from both.

![](images/Top 10 Schools.png)

From the data, the **top 10 schools** with the highest enrollment rates are:  

| **School Name**                                | **Enrollment Rate (%)** |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Highlands Community Charter                   | 85.6%                  |
| North Star Academy Charter School             | 83.7%                  |
| Alabama Connections Academy                   | 65.1%                  |
| Reading SHS                                   | 85.7%                  |
| California Virtual Academy @ Los Angeles      | 73.7%                  |
| Upper Darby SHS                               | 95.0%                  |
| River Springs Charter                         | 57.8%                  |
| North Shore Senior High                       | 85.7%                  |
| Visions in Education                          | 55.2%                  |
| Paramount High                                | 94.3%                  |

Throughout the rest of this analysis, our team chose to focus on these 10 schools. 

## 1.2 - Minority Breakdown for the Top 10 Schools with the Most Free and Reduced Lunch Enrollments

Now, we want to break down the ratio of minority students within these schools. 

Here’s a clean and organized version for your **Analysis Page** using headings, bullet points, and tables to make the information clear and easy to digest:

Among the top 10 schools with the highest enrollment rates of students in the Free and Reduced Lunch programs, those with the largest minority populations—particularly African American and Hispanic students—also had the highest number of students relying on these government programs. This suggests a potential correlation between a larger African American and Hispanic student population and increased program participation. In the following section, we will cross-reference this data with census data to examine whether a higher minority population in general corresponds to a greater percentage of students enrolled in these programs.

## 1.3 Top 10 Schools with the Largest Minority Populations

Another part of our team’s analysis included finding the top 10 schools with the highest minority populations to see if they would match the schools with the highest enrollment rates in Free and Reduced Lunch programs. The list was as follows:

| **School Name**                                | **Minority Percentage (%)** |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| North Star Academy Charter School             | 98.7%                  |
| Reading SHS                                   | 95.9%                  |
| Brooklyn Technical High School                | 77.3%                  |
| California Virtual Academy @ Los Angeles      | 83.4%                  |
| Granada Hills Charter                         | 75.6%                  |
| Duncanville H S                               | 98.1%                  |
| North Shore Senior High                       | 96.0%                  |
| River Springs Charter                         | 63.4%                  |
| John A. Ferguson Senior High                  | 96.7%                  |
| Blue Ridge Academy                            | 61.1%                  |

Several schools appeared on both lists—**North Star Academy Charter School**, **Reading SHS**, **California Virtual Academy @ Los Angeles**, and **North Shore Senior High**—further supporting our theory that a higher proportion of minority students is associated with a greater percentage of students enrolled in Free and Reduced Lunch programs.

## Section 2: Cross-Comparison

After finding the top ten schools with the largest amount of students in Free and Reduced Lunch Programs above, we aim to see if there is a correlation between the proportion of minorities in those schools and the proportion of minorities in the surrounding county. 

Here’s a clean and organized version for your **Analysis Page** using headings, bullet points, and tables to make the information clear and easy to digest:

One observation is that a high minority population at a school does not seem to necessarily correlate with the zip code the school is located in. Several schools yielded over 50% minority but the zip code yielded less than 25% minority; such as Upper Darby SHS and to a lesser extent, Athens Academy and Visions in Education. This helps to illustrate the extent of school segregation that takes place in our country. 

## Section 3: Statistical Modeling
### 3.1 - Modeling

Two models were used, namely, a negative binomial regression, and a logistic regression. Running the code below gives summary statistics with estimated coefficients and p values. For the negative binomial model, coefficients were exponentiated to convert them into rate ratios. Example interpretation: `American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23` has a rate ratio of 1.0023239. This means that, for every additional American Indian/Alaska Native student at a school, we can expect the count of free-lunch program enrolments at that school to increase by 0.23%. The first plot below shows the rate ratios for each race. Also, based on the summary statistics, all races have a statistically significant p value at the 5% level, and Asian students were the only race with a rate ratio slightly less than 1. This implies that for every additional Asian student at a school, we can expect the count of free-lunch program enrolments at that school to decrease very slightly. The plot below shows that American Indian/Alaska Native students brought the most impact into their schools regarding increasing free-lunch enrollment, while White and Asian students are much less impactful. There is also a relatively larger variance for American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and Two or More Races students as opposed to the rest of the groups.

```{r}
library(MASS) # Used for negative binomial regression

data$`Free Lunch Eligible [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`Free Lunch Eligible [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`Black or African American Students [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`Black or African American Students [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`White Students [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`White Students [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`Hispanic Students [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`Hispanic Students [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`Nat. Hawaiian or Other Pacific Isl. Students [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`Nat. Hawaiian or Other Pacific Isl. Students [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`Two or More Races Students [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`Two or More Races Students [Public School] 2022-23`)
data$`Total Race/Ethnicity [Public School] 2022-23` <- as.numeric(data$`Total Race/Ethnicity [Public School] 2022-23`)

# Negative Binomial Regression

negative_binomial_model <- glm.nb(`Free Lunch Eligible [Public School] 2022-23` ~ `White Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Black or African American Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Hispanic Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander [Public School] 2022-23` + `Nat. Hawaiian or Other Pacific Isl. Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Two or More Races Students [Public School] 2022-23`, data)

summary_model_nb <- summary(negative_binomial_model)

coef_table <- coef(summary_model_nb)
exp_coef <- exp(coef_table[, "Estimate"])
conf_intervals <- exp(confint(negative_binomial_model))
p_values <- coef_table[, "Pr(>|z|)"]

results <- data.frame(race = rownames(coef_table), rate_ratio = exp_coef, confidence_lower = conf_intervals[, 1], confidence_higher = conf_intervals[, 2], p_val = p_values)

print(results)

results <- results[results$race != "(Intercept)", ]

ggplot(results, aes(y = race, x = rate_ratio)) + geom_point() + geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = confidence_lower, xmax = confidence_higher), height = 0.2, color = "red") + labs(y = "Race", x = "Rate Ratio") + theme_minimal()

print(summary_model_nb)
```

The second model used was a logistic regression with a binary outcome variable indicating whether a majority of students at a school are enrolled in a free lunch program. Running the code would produce summary statistics and the second plot below illustrates the relationship. We did a regression on estimating the probability of a school having the majority of its students enrolled in a free-lunch program based on the percentage of minority students the school has. `minority_percentage` has a statistically significant odds coefficient of 1.0397006 at the 5% level, implying that a 1 percentage point increase in a school’s minority population is associated with a 3.97% increase in the odds that a school has the majority of its students enrolled in a free lunch program. It can also be seen that, as the percentage of minority students at a school increases, the probability of the majority of a school’s students being enrolled in a free lunch program increases exponentially, based on the nonlinear and positive relationship illustrated.

```{r}
# Logistic Regression
data <- data |>
  mutate(minority_percentage = ((`Black or African American Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Hispanic Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander [Public School] 2022-23` + `Nat. Hawaiian or Other Pacific Isl. Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Two or More Races Students [Public School] 2022-23`) / `Total Race/Ethnicity [Public School] 2022-23`) * 100) |>
  mutate(majority_free_lunch = if_else(`Free Lunch Eligible [Public School] 2022-23` / `Total Race/Ethnicity [Public School] 2022-23` > 0.5, 1, 0))

logistic_model <- glm(majority_free_lunch ~ minority_percentage, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data)

summary_model_l <- summary(logistic_model)

coef_table <- coef(summary_model_l)
exp_coef <- exp(coef_table[, "Estimate"])
conf_intervals <- exp(confint(logistic_model))
p_values <- coef_table[, "Pr(>|z|)"]

results <- data.frame(race = rownames(coef_table), odds = exp_coef, confidence_lower = conf_intervals[, 1], confidence_higher = conf_intervals[, 2], p_val = p_values)

minority_percentages <- data |>
  summarize(min_minority = min(minority_percentage), max_minority = max(minority_percentage))|>
  summarize(minority_percentage = seq(min_minority, max_minority, length.out = 100))

minority_percentages$predicted_probability <- predict(logistic_model, newdata = minority_percentages, type = "response")

ggplot(data, aes(x = minority_percentage, y = majority_free_lunch)) + geom_line(data = minority_percentages, aes(x = minority_percentage, y = predicted_probability)) + labs(x = "Percentage of Minorities at a School", y = "Predicted Probability") + theme_minimal()

print(summary_model_l)
print(results)
```

The analysis sheds light on some key socioeconomic issues around the country. There seems to be an evident racial disparity according to these models, where certain minority races have a greater impact on a school’s total free-lunch enrolment numbers than others, and that schools with a higher minority percentage of their student population tend to have higher chances of the majority of their student body being enrolled in these programs. This raises some questions on the factors contributing to this disparity. Does a greater proportion of American Indian/Alaska Native students or their families meet the requirements to be enrolled in a lunch program compared to Asian students? If enrollment is not automatic, could it be that students or families of certain races are more willing to apply for these free lunch programs? 


### 3.2 - Limitations

The two or more races variable might have some confounding effects on the rest of the variables (if the data collection survey allowed for people to select multiple races, i.e. selecting White + Asian rather than the singular two or more races option, then the confounding effects might be even more severe). This could lead to bias induced in the estimated rate ratios for each race. Multicollinearity might also be a problem, as it may be likely that schools with a high percentage of a certain minority group might also have a high percentage of another minority group. Another problem with the two or more races variable is that there is a lot of ambiguity, and potentially varied results if we were to split it up into the different racial combinations. For example, students who are black and asian might have different results compared to students who are hispanic and black. Having this specific information could result in better estimates for each race.
